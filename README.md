#### I'm Learning Git! (along with Bash, Python & JavaScript)

I built my own smart home entertainment network (powered by LMCE) back before smart-TVs were even a thing, *but I've never **really** written any serious code.* This is where I will plan and document my journey as I learn to do just that. **Please join me along the way!** Everyone is welcome and so are your comments, questions and criticisms! Just please try to stay constructive and **don't be mean!**
