#### Some Goals for Git...
    -repos for my own scripts and automations
    -individual repos for each device, system or, whatever.
    -establish a point of reference using github pages
    

  
#### Some Goals in General...
    -update/upgrade home systems
    -automate using python, bash, & js
      -financial
      -home/away profiles
      -home/assistant ai  
      -email scraping (text & attachments)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/imlearninggit/imlearninggit/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
